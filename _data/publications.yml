    authors: S Qian, Y Lu, Y Peng, CC Shen, <u>Huacen Xu</u> - <i>Public Relations Review, 2024</i>  
    conference: Through unsupervised image clustering, we identified five main categories of climate change visuals.

These differences also extended to visual features like color tones and the presence of faces. Our findings emphasize the importance of tailoring visual content to platform-specific characteristics when communicating about climate change on social media.
