## Research Interest

While continuing my professional work, I also pursue academic research, as I believe in the value of academic research in industry applications. My work focuses on two main areas:

- The first centers on applying advanced AI techniques to develop predictive models that uncover disparities across social structures in our financial system. For example, I investigate how social norms and stratification influence life chances and financial outcomes. By incorporating and quantifying these macro and individual factors, we can improve financial modeling in our fast-changing, highly polarized, and divided society. I aim to expand my work in this area.
- The second focus is on science communication, particularly regarding public perceptions of AI technologies. This includes studying the political polarization of science, which highlights the importance of ideologies and worldviews in shaping our responses to issues such as COVID-19, vaccination, and AI applications.
